## My git workflow

In this project I try to use:

- Good commit messages
- Well named branches
- Pull requests with summaries


Here is my branching model for this project.

```
master (auto deploys) ______________________
                       \               /
development             \_____________/- pull request
                         \           /
feature/some-feature      \_commits_/- pull request
```

## My agile workflow and Trello board

I try to maintain a backlog eventhough I'm working on a project by myself. That way people can quickly jump in and start helping out. It also displays how I split up my tasks and try to build this project in an iterative and incremental way!

## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli. 

**[The standard create-react-app docs can be found in here](./create-react-app-docs.md)**
